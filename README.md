              "npx create-react-app my-app"
    Replace my-app with your desired project name.
    
  Move Into the Project Directory:
    
    Navigate into your new project directory:
    bash
    
              "cd my-app"
  Install Required Packages:
    
    Ensure you have the necessary dependencies installed. Run the following commands:
