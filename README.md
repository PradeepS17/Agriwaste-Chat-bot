The prototype is a web application that includes a language selection feature and an AI chatbot. The user starts by selecting their preferred language on a beautifully styled language selection page. After selecting a language, they are redirected to the chatbot page, where they can interact with an AI assistant. The chatbot can store and display the conversation history. Additionally, the application includes user authentication pages such as login, registration, and password reset, all styled for a modern and attractive appearance.
